Mitch Weaver's Gentoo files

* GentooLTO with up-to-date workarounds
* custom cflags both for performance and hardening
* package.use, used with hardened profile
* kernel configs
* install encrypted ZFS + properly setup GentooLTO without issues

More info to come as I clean this up to make it more presentable.

## Future

Once I finish my website I plan to write formal guides as I feel
Gentoo is demonized as being a "difficult" or "needlessly complex"
distro when in my opinion it couldn't be further from the truth.
Gentoo is a breath of fresh air once you learn how to properly use the
power emerge gives you.
