## Future

Once I finish my [website](https://wvr.sh) I plan to write formal guides as I feel
Gentoo is demonized as being a "difficult" or "needlessly complex"
distro when in my opinion it couldn't be further from the truth.
Gentoo is a breath of fresh air once you learn how to properly use the
power emerge gives you.

## Quotes

> Gentoo is for when you know what you want, and don't want, and just you want the distro to stay out of the way and not tell you "you can't do that".

> Switching to Gentoo is like getting finally a relationship that isn't toxic where random fights don't occur and you start thinking how the fuck you coped out with the abusive ex, right?
